## For loops

four patterns of for loops

* If you "know how many times" you need to do something, you will likely want to use a for loop. The four patterns of four loop below are most common, and will be your best tools for solving iterative problems.

```
for i in range(low, high):
    print(i)

for i in range(len(lst)):
    print(lst[i])

for element in lst:
    print(element)

for i, element in enumerate(lst):
    print(i)
```
